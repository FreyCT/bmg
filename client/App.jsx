// BrowserRouter: BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history 
// API(pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. 
// It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.

// Routes: Itâ€™s a new component introduced in the v6 and a upgrade of the component. 
// The main advantages of Routes over Switch are: Relative s and s
// Routes are chosen based on the best match instead of being traversed in order.

// Route: Route is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.

// Link: Link component is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. It works like HTML anchor tag.
