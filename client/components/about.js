                    <h2>Artist statement</h2>
                    <p> Aesthetically, my work takes on many different forms of which I attribute to the improvisational processes 
                        I take when referencing the imagination as a source of the Unknown. My silkscreen prints on canvas are large 
                        in appearance and reflect the human body. They challenge traditional methods of printing by building basic geometric
                        shapes into compositional patterns of sacred geometry to construct mandalas as opposed to layering. 
                        They become a cosmo-gram representing the entirety of the universe, including the world we live in. 
                        The mandalas are silkscreened in bright colours representing a full spectrum of Life and others, with human blood. 
                        These become self portraits of the individuals whose blood I use to create the mandala and act as a 
                        gateway to transcend the identity of a person out out of the physical and into the spiritual. 
                        The mandala be- comes a supernatural personification in its association with the divine and its outer space. 
                        A sa- cred space, literally, through use in one of a kind DNA and/or majestic colouring patterns that evoke 
                        the senses and engage the emotions. In titling the blood mandalas, I leave the subjects anonymous, 
                        identifying them instead by age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, substance dependen- cies, and blood-borne 
                        diseases that acknowledge a history of prejudice and misinformation re- garding sexuality, addiction, and illness. 
                        The result being a contemporary dialog that juxtaposi- tions the subject matter to the criticality of its 
                        compositional references. My paintings however, take on an a lighter approach, often undermining any form
                        of representa- tional logic at all. They are large in scale and painted on canvas and panels in bright bold 
                        spec- trums of colour. Life-like organic forms intersect with hard shapes and exact lines to create illu- sionistic
                        spaces that act as fields of energy intended to stimulate the imagination of the viewer. Monsters creep in at times
                        and the viewer may be whisked away to earlier years of childhood. At times these works appear frenetic; Manic displays
                        that push the boundaries of space to exces- siveness, often overwhelming a viewer with a means to the madness. 
                        This is symbolic to the artists personal struggles with bi-polar disorder and his journeyâ€™s through the other world
                        of delusion and psychosis. There is always harmony within the work that acts to stabilize its overall perception. 
                        This creates pleasurable moments of whimsicality in the eye of the viewer no matter where your gaze takes you. 
                        The result is an experiential documentation of the imaginary worlds within the minds eye. The sensational
                        effects produced by the work transmute an infinite poten- tial to perceive information into a finite form 
                        of expression that at best, resembles an intended feeling of awe and wonder.
